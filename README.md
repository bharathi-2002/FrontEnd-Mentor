# FrontEnd-Mentor
This Repo contains my own of Solving the Frontend-Mentor Challenges... 

Hey There I'm Bharathi Shavakkar... 

In in Repository... I upload my Files that I use to challenge myself.

The Frontend Mentor is a platform that I use to do work with... and it usually take me some 4 hours to complete a project...
My timings will be like, after completing the college class hours, I get back at some 6 or 6.30 pm, and start to do these till 10.30 or sometime 9.

I practise these for quite sometime... but in-between I take some break... to study someother things to not to burn myself...
I watch some YouTube videos to relax or someother computer Related stuffs or Udemy courses...
Then... it will be time to sleep... and At morning... I start to do these once again by 7.30 am to 8.20 possibly and getting back to college...


Thanks For Reading... :)
